# Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker is a fully responsive web application developed using **Django** and seamlessly integrated with **Tailwind CSS**. Designed to efficiently manage personal finances, the application allows users to track their expenses and incomes through a user-friendly interface. Key features include robust user authentication, full CRUD functionality for managing expenses and incomes, and the ability to export financial data in various formats, such as PDF, CSV, and Excel. This project not only serves as a practical financial tool but also showcases the integration of Tailwind CSS with Django to create a modern, responsive user experience.

This project significantly contributed to the enhancement of my knowledge in **Django** and **Tailwind CSS**.
