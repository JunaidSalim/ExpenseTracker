# Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker is a fully functional and responsive web application built using **Django** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. This project not only serves as a personal expense and income tracking tool but also demonstrates how Tailwind CSS can be integrated seamlessly with Django. The app includes features such as CRUD operations for managing expenses and incomes, user authentication, and exporting data to various formats.

This project significantly contributed to the enhancement of my knowledge in **Django** and **Tailwind CSS**.
